# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

This project focuses on learning and practicing JavaScript techniques for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM allows developers to dynamically interact with and modify the structure, content, and style of web pages.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure of the DOM.
- Use JavaScript to select and manipulate DOM elements.
- Handle events to create interactive web pages.
- Modify styles and attributes dynamically.
- Create, update, and remove elements in the DOM.

## Project Structure

This directory contains the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for testing DOM manipulation scripts.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file containing DOM manipulation code.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Link the `script.js` file to the HTML file if not already linked.
3. Modify the `script.js` file to practice DOM manipulation techniques.
4. Refresh the browser to see the changes in action.

## Examples of DOM Manipulation

- Changing the text content of an element.
- Adding or removing classes to style elements dynamically.
- Creating new elements and appending them to the DOM.
- Handling user interactions like clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
