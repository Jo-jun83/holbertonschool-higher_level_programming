## Introduction
In this project, we explore the concept of exceptions in Python. Exceptions are events that can modify the normal flow of a program's execution. Proper handling of exceptions is crucial for building robust and error-resistant applications.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand what an exception is and how to use it.
- Handle exceptions using `try` and `except` blocks.
- Raise exceptions using the `raise` statement.
- Use the `finally` block to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred.
- Create custom exception classes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE of your choice

## Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files:
- `0-safe_print_list.py`: Function that prints `x` elements of a list.
- `1-safe_print_integer.py`: Function that prints an integer with `"{:d}".format()`.
- `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`: Function that prints the first `x` integers of a list.
- `3-safe_print_division.py`: Function that divides two integers and prints the result.
- `4-list_division.py`: Function that divides element by element 2 lists.
- `5-raise_exception.py`: Function that raises a type exception.
- `6-raise_exception_msg.py`: Function that raises a name exception with a message.

## Usage
To run any of the scripts, use the following command:
```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```
Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you want to execute.
