## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It covers the basics of control flow in Python, including conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use if/else statements
- Use loops to iterate over data
- Define and call functions
- Understand variable scope and lifetime
- Use the return statement to return values from functions

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- Basic knowledge of Python syntax

## Files

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: A script that prints whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.py`: A script that prints the last digit of a number.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A script that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A script that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'q' and 'e'.
- `4-print_hexa.py`: A script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
- `5-print_comb2.py`: A script that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: A script that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- `7-islower.py`: A function that checks for lowercase characters.
- `8-uppercase.py`: A function that prints a string in uppercase.
- `9-print_last_digit.py`: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
- `10-add.py`: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- `11-pow.py`: A function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.
- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three prints "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints "Buzz".
