# Python Test Driven Development
Welcome to the Python Test Driven Development project. This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on writing tests for Python code to ensure its correctness and reliability.

## Introduction

In this project, you will learn how to write tests for your Python code using the `doctest` module. Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process where you write tests before writing the actual code. This approach helps in identifying and fixing bugs early in the development cycle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `doctest` module
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-test_driven_development.git
cd python-test_driven_development
```

## Usage

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
```

Make sure to write your tests in the `tests` directory and follow the naming convention `test_*.txt`.

## Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
