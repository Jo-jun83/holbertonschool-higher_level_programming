## Description
In this project, we explore the principles of inheritance in Python. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This helps in code reusability and the creation of more complex data structures.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the concept of inheritance in Python
- Create a class that inherits from another class
- Override methods in the parent class
- Understand the differences between class and instance attributes

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python programming
